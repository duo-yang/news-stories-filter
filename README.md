Final Project for SI 507

This project aims to provide a site enable the reader to 'beep' certain keywords on the [New York Times Today's Newspaper](http://www.nytimes.com/pages/todayspaper/index.html) site LOCALLY on their browser and provide a better interface for reading news.
The end goal would be a scenario where if the viewer is tired of news stories with certain keywords in them, say 'Trump', they can avoid those stories on the frontpage altogether, and get a much more enjoyable frontpage news.

The other function of the tool is search for certain key words and only search those stories, like only viewing stories about 'Trump' for the thillseekers.

The project is built on Flask.
