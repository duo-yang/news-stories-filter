Final Project for SI 507

In this project, I am planning to do a 'find and replace' tool for a major newspaper site (Washington Post) to enable the reader to 'beep' certain keywords on its front page LOCALLY (I am thinking of host it on my server but I fear there might cause some legal troubles).
The end goal would be a scenario where if the viewer is tired of news stories with certain keywords in them, say 'Trump', they can change those stories on the frontpage into something they might like, say 'panda', and get a much more enjoyable frontpage news.
